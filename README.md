# Linear-Probing-Hash-Table

## What this Project is
This hash table was an assignment for my Algorithms computer science course. The goal was to implement a hash table by hand. Additional credit was earned by implementing a linear probing hash table rather than a traditional separate chaining table. Employing the linear probling was rewarded as the structure of the table is less straightforward, and certain operations such as deletion require extra thought to both understand and implement.

## Involved Parties
I created hashtable.py in accordance to requirements set by Dr. Adam A. Smith. Supporting files (not included here) for the sake of testing and trouble shooting made by Dr. Smith were available for use.

## Instructions
This code does not require any additional files or packages to be run. However, it has no main method, and will not produce anything of value if run independently. It is designed to be utilized by programs in other files.
